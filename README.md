# SHELLALL
*SHELLALL: A Suite of C Programs for Shell Management*

Here's a basic outline of a C program suite for SHELLALL with functionalities as discussed:

# shell_download.c:

       Downloads the specified shell source code archive based on a provided URL.
       Checks the download integrity using the SHA-256 checksum.
       Extracts the archive to a temporary directory.
       Returns the extracted directory path and archive filename for further processing.

# shell_verify.c:

       Compares the extracted shell source code version with the latest available version online.
       Retrieves the latest version information from the respective shell website or kernel.org.
       Returns a boolean indicating if the downloaded version is the latest.

# shell_build.c:

       Takes the extracted directory path and archive filename as input.
       Runs the build script (make) for the specific shell.
       Handles build options and configuration based on the current system (e.g., kernel version).
       Detects and logs potential build errors.
       Returns a boolean indicating successful build completion.

# shell_install.c:

       Copies the compiled shell executable to the appropriate location in the system path (e.g., /bin).
       Handles installation dependencies if needed.
       Manages shell configuration files and environment variables.
       Returns a boolean indicating successful installation.

# shell_manager.c:

       Provides a command-line interface for users to interact with SHELLALL.
       Allows specifying the list of shells to download and build.
       Displays progress messages, build logs, and error information.
       Orchestrates the execution of individual programs in the suite.
\
*Supporting Programs:*

# utils.c: 
    Contains utility functions for string manipulation, file handling, and system calls.
# config.h: 
    Stores configuration variables like default shell download directory and system paths.


Example Usage:

# $ ./shell_manager -l bash zsh tcsh
This command instructs SHELLALL to download and build the latest versions of bash, zsh, and tcsh shells.

Please note:

*This is a simplified overview of the program suite. Each program needs further implementation details and error handling based on specific shell build configurations and potential issues.*

*You will need to adapt the code to integrate specific download URLs, build scripts, and installation paths for each chosen shell.*

*For advanced features like automatic updates and customizable build options, additional programs and functionalities would be required.*
